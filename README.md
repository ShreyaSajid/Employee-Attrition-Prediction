# Employee Attrition Prediction
One of the biggest challenges faced by multitude of organizations in the recent past is employee attrition. Attrition rate is the number of employees leaving the organization. It is normally expressed as a percentage which reflects the degree of losses of an employee due to various causes within a specific period of time. The factors causing attrition can be both internal and external.

## In this repository
In this project, I try to understand & analyze the reason for job attrition using an open source sample data set. I also attempt to build a classification model to predict the same. This repository includes some exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, modelling and prediction. Since the dataset used was highly imbalanced, I used SMOTE to tackle the variance.
