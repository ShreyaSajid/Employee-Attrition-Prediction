# Project1_EmployeeAttrition
One of the biggest challenges faced by multitude of organizations in the recent past is employee attrition. Attrition rate is basically the number of employees leaving the organization. It is normally expressed as a percentage which reflects the degree of losses of an employee due to various causes within a specific period of time. The factors causing attrition can be both internal and external.
In this project, I try to understand & analyze the reason for job attrition using an open source sample data set. I also attempt to build a classification model to predict the same.
